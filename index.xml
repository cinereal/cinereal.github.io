      <description>Introduction to Capture One [Part 1] The Lens Menu Lens Correction Depending on your lens and camera you might get either one of the following profiles.
Manufacturer Profile: Manufacturers supply enough data in the RAW file to generate a profile.
Lens Specific Profile: Means Capture One has a profile of your lens with additional Sharpness Falloff correction.
 General Note It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to set Capture One&amp;rsquo;s default sharpening to 0 while adjusting Chromatic Aberration, Purple Fringing, Diffraction Correction and Sharpness Falloff.</description>

      <description>New Camera, New RAW Editor I recently upgraded my camera and thought this was a good opportunity to re-evaluate my choice of RAW editing software. In the past I tried a few open source options, RawTherapee and darktable. They are both pretty good but I was missing a few features that forced me to keep falling back on Photoshop plus Camera RAW and I never got used to the in my view slightly confusing interfaces.</description>

      <description>The Challenge A few weeks ago I decided to finally upgrade my 10+ year old website. Initially I planned to use a content management system (CMS) but eventually had to realize that this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work with my current web-server due to technical difficulties. The PHP memory limit is set so low on the provider side that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to install a CMS.
The Solution - Static Site Generators (SSG) In recent years static site generators have become more popular.</description>

      <description>Intro My name is Chris. I&#39;m a senior visual effect artist / technical director focused on lighting, compositing and pipeline development.
In the past 10 years I have worked on animated feature and live action films for companies like Lucasfilm, Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Animal Logic.
A long time ago My career started in a different field, as a mechanical engineer developing robots in my home country Switzerland, far away from any movie production.</description>
