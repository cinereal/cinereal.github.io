      <description>In 2009 when I started working in the Visual Effects and Animation Industry I made a page with links to studios around the world: cgart.info
Since then I haven&#39;t updated the list and many of the companies have disappeared over time. To my surprise is the site still pretty popular but it needs serious updating. It should also stay as simple as the current one. The only addition will be a sorting and maybe a search function as well as direct links to the job postings which are often done by third party websites.</description>

      <title>Github Pages for your Website</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We go over GitHub Pages and set up a simple website to get familiar with the GitHub interface and learn how to use Git via command line to sync up your local repository of any existing page to your GitHub page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-bit-of-background-on-the-topic-before-we-get-started&#34;&gt;A bit of background on the topic before we get started.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating your website, blog or a simple portfolio page you&amp;rsquo;ll eventually come to the point where you need to find a service to host it.
Generally you have to choose between a paid service or try one of the free options that are often not reliable, slow or include ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There another option which is free as well, reliable and even has some features that traditional website services don&amp;rsquo;t include, &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. You might have heard of Git and GitHub or even used it as version control system. Many companies use it in technical departments, wherever code is involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also works great to host any type of static websites (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cinereal.github.io/article/new-website-static-site-generator/&#34;&gt;More about static websites&lt;/a&gt;).
My entire website is hosted on GitHub: &lt;a href=&#34;https://cinereal.github.io/&#34;&gt;cinereal.github.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub pages have the added benefit of enforced SSL encryption (HTTPS) and of course free version control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s the catch? It only works for static websites. Meaning if you are using a CMS or any script that dynamically generates pages or requires execution on a server it will not work. Anything PHP won&amp;rsquo;t work. What will work are script that are run on the client machine such as JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays Static Site Generators are great alternatives to CMSs. You can create an entire website without a line of code if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to dive too deep into web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s projects that go even a step further, they provide a CMS to edit content, generate static site and sync your git repositories. The most popular one is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlifycms.org/&#34;&gt;netlifycms.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lens Cast Calibration in Capture One</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lens-cast-calibration-lcc&#34;&gt;Lens Cast Calibration (LCC)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lens Cast Calibration as to be done specifically for a shot setup hence it&amp;rsquo;s grayed out until a preset is created and applied. Each lens, camera, setting and lighting situation requires a unique calibration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cinereal.github.io/images/captureone/lcc.png&#34; alt=&#34;LCC Profile&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-lens-cast-calibration&#34;&gt;What is Lens Cast Calibration?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short we are trying to minimize the uneven white balance throughout the image introduced due to a various factors. In many cases we can ignore it since it&amp;rsquo;s not noticeable unless we have a side-by-side comparison. But there are cases where it&amp;rsquo;s important to have an even white balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these cases are snowy landscapes, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been shooting recently. This type of photography exposes issues in the white balance as illustrated in the photo below.
See how the color shifts towards the edges into a bluish darker tone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cinereal.github.io/images/captureone/nolcc1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;LCC Off Image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wide angle lenses are impacted the most as they gather light from more directions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your lens and camera you might get either one of the following profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturer Profile:&lt;/strong&gt; Manufacturers supply enough data in the RAW file to generate a profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lens Specific Profile:&lt;/strong&gt; Means Capture One has a profile of your lens with additional Sharpness Falloff correction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Raw Editor - Capture One</title>
      <link>https://cinereal.github.io/article/captureone/</link>

      <description>New Camera, New RAW Editor I recently upgraded my camera and thought this was a good opportunity to re-evaluate my choice of RAW editing software. In the past I tried a few open source options, RawTherapee and darktable. They are both pretty good but I was missing a few features that forced me to keep falling back on Photoshop plus Camera RAW and I never got used to the in my view slightly confusing interfaces.</description>

      <title>New Website - Static Site Generators</title>
      <link>https://cinereal.github.io/article/new-website-static-site-generator/</link>

      <description>The Challenge A few weeks ago I decided to finally upgrade my 10+ year old website. Initially I planned to use a content management system (CMS) but eventually had to realize that this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work with my current web-server due to technical difficulties. The PHP memory limit is set so low on the provider side that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to install a CMS.
The Solution - Static Site Generators (SSG) In recent years static site generators have become more popular.</description>
